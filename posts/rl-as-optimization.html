          <p>When I first learned about deep reinforcement learning, I was extremely
confused how RL could fit in with deep learning – the two topics seem
totally different, at least in the ways they’re presented! The trick is
to understand that RL is simply optimizing a particular loss function,
and we can thus view it in the context of optimization and make a direct
comparison to supervised learning. In this post, we will show how the
REINFORCE algorithm, used commonly in reinforcement learning, is
actually a very general idea.</p>
<h1>Classical Reinforcement Learning</h1>
<p>First, a quick primer on reinforcement learning.</p>
<p>The classical setup of reinforcement learning is that we have an agent
who lives in an environment with states $\mcS$ and can make actions
$\mcA$ which causes them to transition to a new state. Depending on the
state and action pair, they then receive some reward $r \in \reals$.</p>
<p>We can formalize these ideas with Markov decision processes (MDPs). An
MDP has the following parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>time horizon $T$, which could be infinite</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>action space $\mcA$</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>state space $\mcS$</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>transition distribution $p(s' | s, a)$ for all
    $s,s' \in \mcS, a \in \mcA$ (this is the Markov ingredient)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>reward function $r : \mcS \times \mcA \to \reals$ for a given state
    and action pair (possibly stochastic)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>time discount factor $\gamma \in (0,1)$</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Suppose we index time with $t = 0, 1, 2, \ldots, T$. The agent starts in
state $s_0$. At time $t$, the agent is in state $s_t$ and decides to
make action $a_t$, receiving reward $r_t = r(s_t, a_t)$. The agent wants
to maximize their total expected discounted reward</p>
<p>$$\mathbb{E}<em>{s_t, a_t, r_t} \left[ \sum</em>{t=0}^T \gamma^t r_t \right]$$</p>
<p>where the expectation is over all sampled <em>trajectories</em>
$s_0, a_0, s_1, a_1, \ldots, s_T, a_T$. To be clear
$s_{t+1} \sim p(s_{t+1}|s_t, a_t)$ throughout the trajectory, and
$r_t \sim r(s_t, a_t)$.</p>
<p>We have here an objective we want to optimize! We’ll revisit this in the
deep learning context, but first we take a look at how we solve it
traditionally.</p>
<h1>Solving the MDP</h1>
<p>To solve the MDP, the agent has a policy function $\pi : \mcS \to \mcA$
that selects the action to make in a given state (possibly stochastic).</p>
<p>In general, we assume that the agent doesn’t know the reward function
$r(s,a)$ or the transition distribution $p(s' | s,a)$ – if they did,
solving the MDP would be possible through dynamic programming methods.
The agent can try to estimate the reward function and transition
distribution – this is known as <em>model-based</em> reinforcement learning,
aptly named since we try to guess the MDP model of the environment.</p>
<p>We instead cover <em>model-free</em> RL where we estimate $\pi$ directly.
Therefore, the <strong>overall strategy</strong> to learn the function
$\pi : \mcS \to \mcA$ will be: by testing out values of $a$ to see what
rewards we get (exploration step), and once we’ve collected enough
evidence, pick the best action $a$ for each step (exploitation).</p>
<h1>Estimating the Policy and Q-learning</h1>
<p>Note that we have a lot of freedom in our learning strategy.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>How do we keep track of our exploration (do we need to save all of
    our sample trajectories)?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How are we going to do exploration (do we make actions completely
    randomly)?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Some preliminary answers:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Short answer: no. Instead of saving our entire sample trajectory, it
    suffices to have training data in the form $(s, a, r, s')$ – this is
    because our transition distribution is Markovian, and the reward $r$
    and next state $s'$ only depends on $s, a$ (not whatever
    came before).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are several exploration strategies, the most common of which
    is $\epsilon$-greedy, where we pick an action uniformly at random
    with probability $\epsilon$ and pick our current best estimate
    action with probability $1-\epsilon$.</p>
<p>Another is to make actions in proportion to states we already think
are “good” - i.e. if we got a lot of reward from a certain action
$a_0$, we are more likely to do $a_0$ (but still do other actions
with some probability!).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>To effectively learn a policy, we can use the trajectory data to
estimate either a value function $V(s)$ or a Q-function $Q(s,a)$ to
summarize our data. $V(s)$ estimates the best total reward we can get if
we start from state $s$ and act optimally; $Q(s,a)$ tracks the same if
we start with action $a$ in state $s$.</p>
<p>Note the direct relation $V(s) = \arg\max_a Q(s,a)$. Also, in optimality
we have</p>
<p>$$V^<em>(s) = \max_{a \in \mcA} r(s,a) + \gamma \mathbb{E}_{s' \sim p(s'|s,a)} [V^</em>(s')]$$</p>
<p>$$Q^*(s,a) = r(s,a) + \gamma \mathbb{E}<em>{s' \sim p(s'|s,a)} \left[ \max</em>{a' \in \mcA} Q(s', a') \right]$$</p>
<p>by recursively defining $V^*$ and $Q^*$ as optimal. These relations are
known as the <strong>Bellman equations</strong>, and they are necessary and
sufficient for optimality.</p>
<p>If we can learn either of these, note the optimal policy will be
$\pi(s) = \arg\max_{a \in\mcA} Q(s,a)$ or also
$\pi(s) = \arg\max_{a \in \mcA} r + \gamma \mathbb{E}_{s' \sim p(s' | s, a)}[ V(s') ]$.</p>
<h4>Q-learning</h4>
<p>One of the standard techniques for reinforcement learning is Q-learning.
We initialize our table of $Q(s,a)$ values to 0, so that our parameters
are $\theta_{s,a} = Q(s,a)$. If we’re in state $s$, make action $a$, and
get reward $r$, we make the update</p>
<p>$$Q(s,a) \gets Q(s,a) + \alpha \left(r + \gamma \max_{a' \in \mcA} Q(s', a') - Q(s,a) \right)$$</p>
<p>where $\alpha$ is a learning rate.</p>
<p>The astute reader will realize that this update rule is actually
gradient descent on some kind of least squares objective! Specifically,
the loss is</p>
<p>$$\mcL = \mathbb{E}<em>{s,a}\left[ \left( Q(s,a) - (r(s,a) + \gamma \mathbb{E}</em>{s' \sim p(s'|s,a)}[ \max_{a'} Q(s', a') ]) \right)^2 \right]$$</p>
<p>At optimality, we have that</p>
<p>$$Q(s,a) \equiv r + \gamma \mathbb{E}<em>{s' \sim p(s'|s,a)} \max</em>{a'} Q(s', a')$$</p>
<p>which is exactly the Bellman condition! In Q-learning, we try to satisfy
the Bellman condition through optimizing $\mcL$ by sampling
$s' \sim p(s' | s,a)$ and performing gradient ascent on the parameters
$\theta_{s,a} = Q(s,a)$. Our gradients are, to be clear,</p>
<p>$$\frac{\partial \mcL}{\partial \theta_{s,a}} := r + \gamma \max_{a' \in \mcA} Q(s', a') - Q(s,a)$$</p>
<p>which come from differentiating $\mcL$ and sampling. Thus our Q-learning
update is very well motivated.</p>
<h1>Tie-in to Deep Learning</h1>
<p>In our Q-learning loss, there is nothing that says we have to
parametrize it as a table of values $\theta_{s,a} = Q(s,a)$. We can
instead use a neural network $Q(s,a; \theta)$ where $\theta$ are
parameters of some arbitrary net (could have convolutions, MLPs, etc.).
Then, using training tuples $(s, a, r, s')$, we can do backpropagation
in the usual way to get gradients $\partial \mcL / \partial \theta$.
Specifically, the gradients come out to be</p>
<p>$$\frac{\partial \mcL}{\partial \theta} := (r + \gamma \max_{a' \in \mcA} Q(s', a') - Q(s,a)) \frac{\partial Q(s, a; \theta)}{\partial \theta}$$</p>
<p>That’s all there is to deep Q-learning! You have flexibility to choose
how to encode your $s,a$ pair, as well as come up with all kinds of
learning schedules, but the core idea is there. You can read about how
(Mnih et al. <a href="#ref-deepatari2015">2015</a>) use this technique to play
Atari games from pixels.</p>
<h1>Policy Gradient</h1>
<p>Instead of learning a proxy Q-function, we can try to solve the MDP
directly. Let’s revisit the objective we want to optimize:</p>
<p>$$\mcL = \mathbb{E}<em>{s_t, a_t} \left[ \sum</em>{t=0}^T \gamma^t r_t(s_t, a_t) \right]$$</p>
<p>Now, we assume our policy is a parameterized stochastic map
$\pi(\cdot; \theta) : \mcS \to \mcA$, so that we draw actions according
to $a_t \sim \pi(a_t | s_t; \theta)$. Immediately, we run into a problem
with backpropagation – how do we backpropagate through the expectation?</p>
<p>The answer is in the classic paper Williams
(<a href="#ref-williams1992reinforce">1992</a>), also known as REINFORCE, the
score function estimator, or the likelihood ratio estimator.<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> Let
the quantity in the expectation be $f(s_t, a_t)$, so that if we write
out the expectation over the $a_t$ in full:</p>
<p>$$\mcL = \sum_t \gamma^t \mathbb{E}<em>{s</em>{t+1} \sim p(s_{t+1} | s_t, a_t)} \sum_{a_t} \pi(a_t | s_t; \theta) r(s_t, a_t)$$</p>
<p>Now we take the gradient with respect to $\theta$:</p>
<p>$$\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial\mcL}{\partial \theta} &amp;= \sum_t \gamma^t \mathbb{E}<em>{s</em>{t+1} \sim p(s_{t+1} | s_t, a_t)} \sum_{a_t} \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta} ( \pi(a_t | s_t; \theta) r(s_t, a_t))  \
&amp;= \sum_t \gamma^t \mathbb{E}<em>{s</em>{t+1} \sim p(s_{t+1} | s_t, a_t)} \sum_{a_t} \frac{\partial \pi(a_t | s_t; \theta)}{\partial \theta} r(s_t, a_t) \
&amp;= \sum_t \gamma^t \mathbb{E}<em>{s</em>{t+1} \sim p(s_{t+1} | s_t, a_t)} \sum_{a_t} \frac{\partial \pi(a_t | s_t; \theta)}{\partial \theta} \frac{\pi(a_t | s_t; \theta)}{\pi(a_t | s_t; \theta)} r(s_t, a_t) \
&amp;= \sum_t \gamma^t \mathbb{E}<em>{s</em>{t+1} \sim p(s_{t+1} | s_t, a_t)} \sum_{a_t} \pi(a_t | s_t; \theta) \frac{\partial \log \pi(a_t | s_t; \theta)}{\partial \theta} r(s_t, a_t) \
&amp;= \sum_t \gamma^t \mathbb{E}<em>{s</em>{t+1} \sim p(s_{t+1} | s_t, a_t),\, a_t \sim \pi(a_t | s_t; \theta)} \frac{\partial \log \pi(a_t | s_t; \theta)}{\partial \theta} r(s_t, a_t) \
&amp;=\mathbb{E}<em>{s</em>{t+1} \sim p(s_{t+1} | s_t, a_t),\, a_t \sim \pi(a_t | s_t; \theta)}\left[  \sum_t \gamma^t  \frac{\partial \log \pi(a_t | s_t; \theta)}{\partial \theta} r(s_t, a_t) \right]\end{aligned}$$</p>
<p>Notice our trick: we used the fact that
$\frac{\partial \log y}{ \partial x } = \frac{\partial y}{\partial x} \frac{1}{y}$.
This allows us to efficiently sample our actions $a_t$ to calculate the
expectation instead of needing to compute a (potentially big) sum over
$a_t$.</p>
<p>Some intution: there is no longer any <em>direct</em> gradient flow backwards
to our parameters. Instead, we need to obtain samples and compute
$\partial \log \pi(a_t | s_t; \theta) / \partial \theta$ and
$r(s_t, a_t)$ – here the signal will come from the reward in
$r(s_t, a_t)$. Good actions $a$ will lead to high reward, leading to a
bigger gradient and increasing the probability $\pi(a)$. Conversely, bad
actions with negative reward will lead to a negative gradient,
decreasing the probability of $\pi(a)$.</p>
<p>The gradients we compute here are known as <em>policy gradients</em> – a
fitting name since we differentiate the log probability of the policy.</p>
<h4>Aside on control variates</h4>
<p>The gradient we just computed is unbiased – sampling has the right
expectation. In practice, people will sample one trajectory to get a
gradient, but this will cause the variance to be very high. There is a
trick to get around this, known as the <em>likelihood ratio trick</em>.</p>
<p>Simply, if we want to get samples for
$\mathbb{E}_{a_t \sim \pi(a_t | s_t; \theta)} \left[ \frac{\partial \log \pi(a_t | s_t; \theta)}{\partial \theta} r(s_t, a_t) \right]$,
this turns out to be equal to</p>
<p>$$\mathbb{E}_{a_t \sim \pi(a_t | s_t; \theta)} \left[ \frac{\partial \log \pi(a_t | s_t; \theta)}{\partial \theta} (r(s_t, a_t) - b) \right]$$</p>
<p>for any $b$ constant with respect to $a_t$. This is because</p>
<p>$$\begin{aligned}
\mathbb{E}<em>{a_t} \left[ \frac{\partial\log \pi(a_t | s_t; \theta)}{\partial \theta} b \right] &amp;= b \sum</em>{a_t} \frac{\partial\log \pi(a_t | s_t; \theta)}{\partial \theta} \pi(a_t  | s_t; \theta)  \
&amp;= b\sum_{a_t} \frac{\partial \pi(a_t | s_t; \theta)}{\partial \theta} \frac{\pi(a_t  | s_t; \theta)}{\pi(a_t | s_t; \theta)} \
&amp;= b\sum_{a_t} \frac{\partial \pi(a_t | s_t; \theta)}{\partial \theta} \
&amp;= b\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta} \sum_{a_t} \pi(a_t | s_t; \theta)  = b\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta} 1 = 0\\end{aligned}$$</p>
<p>So we can freely pick $b$ such that the estimate has the lowest variance - finding the optimal $b$ is outside the scope of this post. However, we
can interpret what $b$ is: instead of our reward $r(s_t, a_t)$ we have
$r(s_t, a_t) - b$, so we can think of $b$ as a baseline reward. In fact,
if we write $b := V(s_t)$ then we can interpret $r(s_t, a_t) - V(s_t)$
as an “advantage function”, i.e. the advantage of choosing $a_t$ in
state $s_t$.</p>
<h1>Stochastic Computation Graphs</h1>
<p>In the RL setup we made our action stochastic and using REINFORCE were
able to backpropagate gradients to the action distribution
$\pi(a_t | s_t; \theta)$. In fact, this technique is very general: in a
neural network setting, it means that if we have stochastic nodes that
are sampled from parameterized distributions, we can compute gradients
without the differentiability condition!</p>
<p>The paper, (Schulman et al. <a href="#ref-schulman2015backprop">2015</a>), neatly
explains how all of this fits together using stochastic computation
graphs.</p>
<p>Basically, a stochastic computation graph is any graph that has nodes
with random variables in addition to deterministic nodes, and the loss
function is defined as the sum of some endpoint nodes. There will then
be three kinds of parameters:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>parameters that come after stochastic nodes, with direct
    deterministic paths to the loss</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>parameters that precede stochastic nodes, which can’t be directly
    differentiated for the loss,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>parameters that have both direct paths to the loss, as well as paths
    that go through stochastic nodes</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>For the first kind, parameters that have direct paths to the loss, we
can compute the gradients with backpropagation as usual.</p>
<p>We turn to REINFORCE for the second kind to get gradients that precede
the stochastic nodes. Recall that in reinforcement learning, our policy
gradient had two main components, the reward $r(s_t, a_t)$ and the
log-probability gradient
$\frac{\partial \log \pi(a_t | s_t; \theta) }{ \partial \theta}$. In a
general stochastic computation graph, the reward is replaced by the sum
of all losses influenced downstream of our stochastic sample – this
makes sense since only those should provide training signal for our
probability distribution.</p>
<p>For the third kind, we can sum up the gradients from each path due to
linearity of gradients.</p>
<p>To make this concrete, here are some examples (from the original paper):</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="../images/scgs.png" /></p>
<p>where circles are stochastic nodes, squares are deterministic nodes.
Notice how the stochastic nodes all result in gradients of the form
$\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta} \log p( - | \theta)$ times the sum of
downstream losses.</p>
<p>It turns out that stochastic computation graphs are everywhere! This
idea has a lot of instantiations – hard attention models (Mnih et al.
<a href="#ref-mnih2014visualattention">2014</a>; Xu et al.
<a href="#ref-xu2015captioning">2015</a>), black box variational inference (BBVI)
(Ranganath, Gerrish, and Blei <a href="#ref-ranganath2014">2014</a>), and of course
policy gradients all use REINFORCE to backpropagate through stochastic
components of their model. We can therefore differentiate stochastic
functions as complicated as we like, as long as we have a loss function
to optimize, and REINFORCE + backpropagation takes care of the rest.</p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>Armed with our new understanding of RL, we can ask the following
question: why is it harder than supervised learning? The key difference
is in the stochasticity: because our signal comes from a sampled scalar
reward, it’s hard to tell which action led directly to a better outcome.
In networks where there is further computation after the stochastic
decision (such as hard attention models), this problem is exacerbated.
Contrast this with supervised learning, where the signal is
backpropagated directly through the entire differentiable network.
Therefore, although the REINFORCE method is very general, in certain
cases it may not be suitable for the problem.</p>
<p>The reason I wrote this blog post is that the ideas of REINFORCE and
stochastic computation graphs are very general, yet it’s hard to see the
connections between the instantiations if you don’t already know about
it. While there are a ton of other topics outside the scope of this post,
I hope this blog post helps you start making the key connections!</p>
