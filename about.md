My name is Jeffrey. I'm currently an AI resident at Google in NYC. Previously I worked at [Vicarious](https://vicarious.com) on computer vision and robotics. I graduated from Harvard in 2017 with a BA in computer science and math, where I was advised by Prof. Alexander (Sasha) Rush of the [Harvard NLP](http://nlp.seas.harvard.edu/) group.

I am originally from Palo Alto, CA.

You can find my resume [here](/assets/jeffreyling.pdf).
