I'm currently working on a startup. Stay tuned!

Until recently I worked at Waymo's Planner ML team where I researched and deployed ML models for driving cars. Before that, I was an AI resident at Google NYC, where I worked on natural language processing and BERT research. And before that, I worked at [Vicarious](https://vicarious.com) on computer vision and robotics. I graduated from Harvard in 2017 with a BA in computer science and math, where I was worked with Prof. Alexander Rush of the [Harvard NLP](https://nlp.seas.harvard.edu/) group.

I am originally from Palo Alto, CA.

Please reach out if you want to talk about anything!
