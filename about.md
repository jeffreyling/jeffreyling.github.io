I”m currently an AI resident at Google in NYC, where I’ve been working on research in natural language processing with a focus on entities and relations. Previously I worked at [Vicarious](https://vicarious.com) on computer vision and robotics. I graduated from Harvard in 2017 with a BA in computer science and math, where I was advised by Prof. Alexander Rush of the [Harvard NLP](http://nlp.seas.harvard.edu/) group.

I’m interested in building large-scale systems for language understanding as well as grounding text to different modalities.

I am originally from Palo Alto, CA.

You can find my resume [here](/assets/jeffreyling.pdf).
